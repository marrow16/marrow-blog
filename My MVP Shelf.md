# My MVP Shelf
_Originally posted 27/08/2018_

As a software developer, I often hear the term “MVP” (Minimal Viable Product).  I thought I knew what MVP means and, for me, it seems to sit nicely with the whole Agile movement (a really good explanation can be found on YouTube at Making sense of MVP).  Unfortunately when I hear product people use the term I wonder if we’re talking about the same thing – for many it seems to mean something like “quickest, dirtiest solution you can cobble together”.  Which is sad. But I decided to run a thought experiment to see how these slightly perverted MVP principles might pan out in the real world…

## Requirements Gathering
A while ago my wife complained that my office (the spare room) was far too messy with books and scribbled notes strewn around the floor.  A fair point.  We agreed that an ideal solution might be to fit some shelves.

## Product Manager Appointment
I’m not so great at DIY but I am a big fan of GSTDIFY (Get Someone Else To Do It For You) so I appointed myself as Product Manager.

## Design Phase
A quick chat with my handyman friend Andy should yield some design ideas – let’s see how that goes…

+ **Me**: _“Hi Andy, I wonder if you’d be available to fit some shelves for me?”_
+ **Andy**: _“Sure mate, what sort of shelving did you have in mind?”_
+ **Me**: _“Just MVP really”_
+ **Andy**: _“MVP?  What on earth does that mean?”_
+ **Me**: _“Minimal Viable Product – just the most basic shelving we can do really”_
+ **Andy**: _“Err, OK, what sort of wood?  Painted?  Brackets? How many?  Size?”_
+ **Me**: _“Whooha, we’re getting way too detailed here – just MVP – have you got any rough timber lying around?”_
+ **Andy**: _“Err, yeah I guess so – what about the brackets?”_
+ **Me**: _“Brackets?  Do we really need brackets?  This is supposed to be MVP after all”_
+ **Andy**: _“Well brackets are a traditional way of hanging shelves… unless you want some of those modern hanging shelves”_
+ **Me**: _“Oh no, that sounds way too over-complicated.  I’m sure you’ll find a way to fix them that isn’t too over-the-top”_
+ **Andy**: _“Ha, sure, I’ll gaffer tape them to the wall for you!”_
+ **Me**: _“That sounds great! Let’s go with that”_
+ **Andy**: _“I was joking!  Seriously, I’ll sort some brackets out for you”_
+ **Me**: _“Let’s not gold-plate this – the gaffer tape idea seems the most economical”_
+ **Andy**: _“Right, so you want some rough planks gaffer taped to a wall?”_
+ **Me**: _“Yep – MVP!”_
+ **Andy**: _“I seriously urge you to think about what you really want – this sounds like a seriously bad idea”_
+ **Me**: _“Andy, I have thought about it – I want MVP shelves”_
+ **Andy**: _“Well, it’s your call – I’ll be round on Tuesday”_

We have a plan!

## Development Phase
Andy pops round with timber under one arm and carrying a large bag containing many, many rolls of gaffer tape.  I’m a bit concerned about the timber though – the planks smell like his dog has peed on them… more than once!  I reassure myself with the thought that this is MVP.

After some faffing around, Andy gets the shelves fitted.  Seems to be quite a lot of gaffer tape involved but they are level.

User Acceptance Testing
The moment has arrived, it’s time to test my MVP shelves.  Pop a tea candle on them and all is looking good.  A marble – doesn’t roll at all… Andy has done an excellent job with the levelling!

Probably time to demo to the other stakeholders. I ask my wife to take a quick look… she utters no words… just “Hmmm” with that look (I know that “that look” – it means “Either you’re joking or I’ve married a complete idiot”).

Into Production
I have my MVP shelves and all is good with the world.  But there do seem to be some teething issues – I’ll give Andy another ring…
+ **Me**: _“Hi Andy, it’s about those shelves you fitted for me”_
+ **Andy**: _“Oh yeah?”_
+ **Me**: _“Seems like every time I put a book on them they fall off the wall”_
+ **Andy**: _“Really?  No shit!  I warned you what a bad idea this was”_
+ **Me**: _“But they don’t really function as shelves”_
+ **Andy**: _“You seemed more interested in your MVP than anything functional”_
+ **Me**: _“This is true but I think I might have over-emphasised the word ‘minimal’ and under-emphasised the ‘viable’ bit”_
+ **Andy**: _“That’s the most sensible thing you’ve said to me recently!”_
+ **Me**: _“So what can we do?”_
+ **Andy**: _“I’ll pop round next Friday and fit some proper shelves for you… so long as you agree to not interfere with the design”_
+ **Me**: _“OK, sounds good”_
+ **Andy**: _“Oh, and it’s gonna cost you twice what it would have done if we’d done it properly to begin with”_
+ **Me**: _“Really? Why??”_
+ **Andy**: _“Cos when I rip that gaffer tape off the wall it’s gonna take paint and plaster with it!”_
